<!-- The following regex excludes all local file paths besides the ones having an '.md' extension.
That is to ignore false positives such as the ones coming from the 'docs/wiki' folder, where internal references are supporting the Wiki formatting.
To avoid ignoring checks on the 'docs/wiki/media' sub-folder, an explicit inclusion is made at lychee argument level, since 'include' has preference over all excludes.
