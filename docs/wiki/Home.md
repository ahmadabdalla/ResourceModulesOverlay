# Common Azure Resource Modules Library

The CARML resource library provides [Bicep](https://github.com/Azure/bicep) modules which can be leveraged in your infrastructure as code project to accelerate solution development. You can re-use the code library as whole or in part. The primary aim is to provide you with re-usable building blocks, so that you can focus what matter the most.
CARML accelerates your solution development, it also saves time on testing, it helps you easily integrate and overall, it provides you with commonality across your infrastructure deployments. You can integrate CARML into your CI/CD pipelines to accelerate your DevOps adoption.

CARML will accelerate the deployment of complex solutions, such as Azure landing zones, landing zone accelerators or individual multi-module applications/workloads.

This wiki describes the content of this repository, its modules, pipelines, and possible options on how to use them and how to contribute to this project.

If you're unfamiliar with Infrastructure as Code or wonder how you can use the content of this repository in your deployments, check out [The context](./The%20context) section of this wiki.

# Scope

In next section, you can find an overview of what is in scope and what is out of scope for CARML.

## In Scope

- **Module library:** CARML is a collection of comprehensive, reusable, Bicep-based building blocks to deploy Azure resources. It can also be combined to create & orchestrate more complex, multi-module Azure solutions.
- **CI environment:** it provides DevOps pipelines. It can be used to validate modules and to publish modules which are successfully validated to a target location. It uses semantic versioning, and it can be used with both GitHub workflows and Azure DevOps pipelines.
- **Documentation:** it includes design principles, usage of [The library](./The%20library) and [The CI environment](./The%20CI%20environment). It also includes step-by-step guidelines on how to start utilizing the CARML Library. For more details, please refer to [Getting started](./Getting%20started) section.

## Out of Scope

- **Orchestration:** Orchestrated, multi-module solutions, such as workloads or applications. As mentioned earlier, you can leverage modules to assemble and deploy such applications/workloads.
- **Languages:** Other domain-specific languages (DSL), like _Terraform_.

## Module update frequency

Modules are updated by a group of committed contributors.
