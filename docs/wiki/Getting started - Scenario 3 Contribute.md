Depending on the contribution you would like to make, the number and implementation of the required steps may vary.

We identify 3 kinds of contributions:

- Contributing to the documentation
- Contributing to the module library
- Contributing to the CI environment

In case your contribution involves changes to the library (the modules) and/or to the CI environment (the pipelines) the required steps to setup your environment are the same listed in the [**Scenario 2:** Onboard module library and CI environment](./Getting%20started%20-%20Scenario%202%20Onboard%20module%20library%20and%20CI%20environment) section.

Also, we suggest to review the corresponding documentation, to ensure your contribution will comply with the CARML design principles. For the library, please refer to [The library overview](./The%20context%20-%20CARML%20library) page and [The library](./The%20library) section. For contributions to the CI environment, please review [The CI environment overview](./The%20context%20-%20CARML%20CI%20environment) page and [The CI environment](./The%20CI%20environment) section.

The step-by-step guideline to follow when contributing to any section of this repository is provided in the [Contribution guide](./Contribution%20guide) dedicated section.
